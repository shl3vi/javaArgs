Should verify the structure and content of the footprints, for a basic console application thats uses inheritance. In this app a static method called methodToHide() is defined in the BaseClass. In addition, DerivedClass declares on a method with the SAME signature, thus it hides it. The test invokes DerivedClass.methodToHide() and verifies that the footprints are sent as expected.
