Should verify the structure and content of the footprints, for a basic console application thats uses inheritance. In this app a new instance of DerivedClass is created and we call the doMagic () method which overrides the implemetion defined in the BaseClass with the new implemention of the DerivedClass.  As part of the new implementation it calls the same method in the BaseClass using the "super" keyword.
